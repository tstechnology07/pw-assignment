    <p>
        In HTML, comments are used to add explanatory notes or remarks within the code that are not visible on the web page when it is rendered in a browser. Comments are helpful for developers to document their code, provide explanations, or temporarily disable specific portions of code during testing or debugging.</p>
        <!-- p tag end -->

        <!-- HTML tags, elements -->
        <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
        <p>h1 is the opening tag, and /h1 is the closing tag. The text "This is a Heading" is the content of the heading element.

            Element:
            
            An HTML element consists of the opening tag, content, and closing tag. The opening tag marks the beginning of the element, the closing tag marks the end, and the content is the data or information contained within the element. Some elements are self-closing and don't have a closing tag.</p>
